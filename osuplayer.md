This is the *official* osu!player plus repository and is mainly developed by [@Founntain](https://github.com/Founntain), with help of [@Cesan](https://github.com/Cesan).  
osu!player plus is a music player for *osu!* with the focus of playing your osu! songs **without having to start osu!**.  

If you find any bugs please report them on the [official osu!player discord](https://discord.gg/RJQSc5B), you can ping me on Discord if you want. You can also report bugs or give feedback via mail at osuplayer@founntain.de.  

*I prefer discord, because chatting is much easier, then waiting for mails. Also the chat is much better stuctured*

## osu!player API and the user system
The osu!player plus has a user system, which is handled by the *osu!player API*. The API handles requests, like creating a profile, editing it, uploading languages and more. It also handles the party system.  
#### Why should I create a profile?
First you would show us that you use the osu!player plus and you want to be a part of this community. However creating a profile gives you some *"extra features"*, like uploading languages and themes. You don't need a profile to use the player, it just extist.  
**[🔸 API Stats can be found here ](https://server.founntain.de)**

## Synced play via Discord or osu!player API
In osu!player plus you get the ability to send invites to discord text-channels (If you enabled discord in the settings) and let other people join your osu!player party. You can also invite people with the party id, they can enter the ID in the join party view. The third option would be making a public party. If the party is public, the party will be open for everyone, they can join party by looking into the join view and select the party they want to join.


The host of the party can choose the songs, playback speed, party publicity and the state (Paused or played). If people have the same song (determined by the songs checksum), the player will play that song. Below is a screenshot of basic party.

*Delay? Yes of course there is one, but only 1, max. 2 seconds.*

## Language Support
Most of the text of osu!player can be translated. However some important parts are not translatable.  
Translating the osu!player is obviously not forced and more work for volunteers. You can get started by opening the *Language Editor*, which you can find in the *Settings > General Settings > Open Language Editor*. When the editor is open, you can simply start translating the player, either by *creating a new language* or by *editing an installed language*.

#### Uploading a translation to the osu!player API
When you are done translating, you can upload the language you have created or edited. If you want to contribute to osu!player translations, you can head into the *Settings > General Settings > Manage Languages*. There you will be able to upload your language. If there is already a translation of the language you are translating, you still will be able to upload it. However you will overwrite it on the server, so only do it, if your language is complete and has any benifits over the existing one.

*You need an osu!player plus profile to upload translations, when you upload a translation, you will get the **translator** role on your profile.*

## Source Code

The source code of the *legacy osu!player* was never released and never will.  
However for the osu!player plus we will release the source code in the near future. We are trying to go *open source* before the end of the year *2020*. And I hope some of you want to contribute to this project, even tho most of the stuff is already done. Bugs and feature requests will always be there.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of the player, so you can get a look of the player.
